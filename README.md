### About:
The idea with this application is that I wanted to create a clean stylish way to learn more about the Ghibli universe since I'm in to this shit, YEAAH! *ehm*.. :octocat:

The functionality is pretty straight forward. You should be able to search and sort by category for information and resources you want to know more about. As it is right now the search input field is not yet implemented. It would definitely be something to look into in the future.

### Technologies Used:
* [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Pace - Automatic Page Load Progess Bar](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/)


### API: [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/)

It is a API that contains information about different Ghibli movies with everything from directors to vehicles seen in the films.

### Process:
I started of with a design of how I wanted the app to look so it would be easier to start structuring the HTML etc. With the coding in general I could have done a better job with how I approached problems. I tested out a lot of stuff that I never ended up using, going back and forth etc. That was a huge time sink which could have been avoided to some extent with more structuring and better planning.

The code that do exist of right now is pretty cleaned up and optimized to my own knowlege ofcourse. Maybe there is a better way to add data to a HTML-block dynamicly for example.

### ToDo:
As I mentioned earlier there is some stuff that I wanted to do but didn't have time for. This is not near finished in my opinion. So here is a short list of things that could be added.

* Search input functionality
* Search for more film specific data
* Film description added through modal or other way

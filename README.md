### About:
The idea with this application is that I wanted to create a clean stylish way to
learn more about the Ghibli universe since I'm in to this shit, YEAAH! *ehm*.. :octocat:

The functionality is pretty straight forward. You should be able to search and sort
by category for information and resources you want to know more about. As of right now
the search input field does not work. It would be something to look into in the future.

### Technologies Used:
* [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/introduction/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Pace - Automatic Page Load Progess Bar](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/)
